 Description<br/>
    Problem1 : Using 0<=x<=1 and intial square wave(u=1 for 0.4<=x<=0.6 and 0 elsewhere). forward in time and central in space scheme as been implemented on 1D diffusion equation for various timesteps.

    problem2: For intial sinusoidal wave with wave number k = 4pi and covcetion velocity of 1m/s .Lax Wendroff and Lax Fredrichs approach have been implemented on 1D convection equation.

    problem3 : For initial input of Heavy side function richmyer and maccormak schemes have been implemented on burgers equation.

    problem4: implicit and explicit eulers scheme as been implemented on wave equation.

    Note: make sure that the main function code and the sub codes have to be in same folder.
    You just need to execute the main code.
    
Target platform<br/>
      These codes are known to work with MATLAB
